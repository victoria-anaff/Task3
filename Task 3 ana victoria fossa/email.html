    <br>SUBJECT: Mighty Ducks Hockey League</br>
  <br> Hi,</br>
  <br>Thanks for your help with the website thus far.<br>
  <br>We have some new information we want to add. Some of our parents suggested that we go ahead and put the game schedule and our play rules and policies on the website.<br>
   
  <br>I've attached the Game Information that we email to parents at the beginning of each season. Can you please add this?</br>
  <br>Also I've attached our rules of play and policies. We'd like to add this information as well. This shouldn't be a lot of work, should it? </br>
  <br>Once we have this part done, I have a hosting service ready to put the site up.</br>
  <br>Thanks,
  <br>Tom Denton
  <br>League Director
  <br>Mighty Ducks Hockey League
